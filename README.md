# Cancer Classification
This project aims to classify cancerous tumors as **benign** or **malignant** using a set of advanced machine learning algorithms. We used multiple algorithms in the analysis, such as **SVM**, **neural networks**, **KNN**, **linear regression**, and **logistic regression**, to ensure accuracy and diversity in the results.

The data we have contains various tumor characteristics, and these algorithms learn from the data to accurately distinguish between tumor types. The ultimate goal is to support physicians in diagnosis and facilitate decision-making, while relying on proven traditional methods in modern medicine and advanced technologies that open new horizons.
